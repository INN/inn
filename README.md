The Institute for Nonprofit News WordPress Theme
===

This is the WordPress child theme used for https://inn.org.

As this is a child theme, it depends on the Largo parent theme which you can grab from: https://github.com/INN/Largo.

If you're not familiar with how parent and child themes work, check out: http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes.

Additionally, the ability to import member stories from RSS feeds depends on this plugin: https://github.com/seamusleahy/feedinput (that we're still working on).
